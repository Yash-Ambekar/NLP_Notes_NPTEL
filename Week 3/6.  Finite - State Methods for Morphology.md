### Finite State Automata (FSA)
-  A finite state automaton is a mathematical model of computation. 
- It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.
- It is a directed graph with each node denoting the state of the model at the given time and each edge directing towards the next stage of the model after a specific input.
- Edges are labelled with symbols (possibly empty $\epsilon$) .
- It recognises regular language i.e. languages specified by RegExs (Regular Expressions)
  
Example:

-  Here $6$ is the accept state which means that the string is part of the given regular language.

#### Properties of FSA
-  Recognition of string can be done in linear time  (length of the string), independent of the size of automaton.
- There is an algorithm to transform each automaton into a unique equivalent automaton with the least number of states.
- An FSA is deterministic if and only if it has no empty ($\epsilon$) transition and for each state and each symbol, there is at most one applicable transition.
- Every Non-Deterministic Automaton (NFA) can be transformed into a Deterministic Automaton (DFA). 


<font color = "Red">FSAs  are Language Recognisers / Generators  but can FSA help us conduct Morphological Analysis?</font>

-  NO, we need Transducer instead to build Morphological Analysers. 
- Because FSA cannot even give lemma of a given word it cannot do the most basic Morphological Analysis i.e. Lemmatization.
----------------------------

### Finite State Transducers
-  They are like FSAs  but each edge is associated with two strings / phoneme.
- It helps translate strings from one language to strings in  another language.

-  It translate one character symbol to another character symbol. In the above figure the edge between  $Q_1$  and  $Q_2$   has symbol  $s$  which is translated to  $\epsilon$ .
- This changes words like $dogs$ , $bags$ , $boys$  to their lemma i.e.  $dog$ , $bag$,  $boy$  respectively.
- For irregular nouns like $men$  it is translated to $man$ , if you see the red highlighted edge value. 

-------------------------

#### Two Level Morphology

-  Given the input cats, we would like to output $cat + N + PL$ , telling us that cat is a plural noun.
- We do this via a version of two level morphology, a correspondence between a lexical level (morphemes and features) to a surface level (actual spelling).

-  Instead of going to surface level  directly from lexical level we can first go to an intermediate level where we add a placeholder before a plural morpheme which can be filled by other morphemes or empty character ($\epsilon$) .

Example:
![[Pasted image 20230606144355.png]]
-  Here the placeholder is ^ and  # is the end of string.
-  The transition from intermediate level to surface level depends on the ending character of the stem and starting character of affix.

FST that implements the above idea in form of an automaton.

-  We can use <font color = "green"> Rule Notation </font> to transition from intermediate level to the surface level.
Example:

-  This rule notation is something which is known as Context Sensitive Grammar.


There are different ways to address phonological / graphemic variations
- **Linguistic approach** : A phonological component accompanying the simple concatenative process of attaching an ending.
- **Engineering approach**: Phonological changes and irregularities are factored into endings and a higher number of paradigms.
Example:
![[Pasted image 20230606145924.png]]

-  Here in the example there are different grammatical functions ($S_1$, $S_2$ ,...., $P_2$) applied to root word for $woman$, $owl$,  $draft$,  $iceberg$,  $vapor$  and  $fly$. 
- So the linguistic approach is to simply declare some grammar rules that depend on the first and last character of root word and affix respectively. The affix remain constant for each word only the root word changes i.e. when a affix is added to the end the transformation the whole word will depend on the rule notations.
- In the Engineering approach, the root word remains the same and affixes are changes.
