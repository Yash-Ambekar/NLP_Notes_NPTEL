### <font color = "green">Definition of Morphology</font>
Morphology studies the internal structure of words, how words are built up from smaller meaningful units called **Morphemes**.

###### Example of Morphemes:
dogs --->  2 morphemes,  $dog$  and  $-s$
unladylike  --->  3 morphemes  i.e. $un-$, $lady$  and  $-like$.

### Allomorphs
-  Variants of the same morpheme, but cannot be replaced by one another.
###### Example of Allomorphs
-  **opposite**: un-happy, in-comprehensible, im-possible, ir-rational etc


### Bound  Morphemes
-  Bound Morpheme are those morphemes that cannot appear as a word itself.
- They are bound by words.
###### Example of Bound Morphemes
$-s$ in dogs,  $-ly$  in quickly,  $-ed$  in walked


### Free Morphemes
-  They can appear as a word by itself; often can combine with other morphemes too.
###### Examples of Free Morphemes
$house$  in house-s,  $walk$  in walk-ed,  $of$,  $the$,  $or$.


### Stems and Affixes
-  **Stems (roots)**:  The core meaning bearing units
- **Affixes**:  Bits and pieces adhering to stems to change their meanings and grammatical functions.
- Mostly stems are free morphemes and affixes are bound morphemes.

### Types of affixes
-  **Prefix** (adding morphemes to the start).
- **Suffix** (adding morphemes to the end) .
- **Infix** (adding morpheme in the middle). Eg: Abso-bloody-lutely.
- **Circumfixes** (precedes and follows the stem)
  In Dutch, mountain means  $berg$  and the plural of mountain is  $ge-berg-te$.

### Inflectional and Derivational Morphology
-  **Inflectional Morphology**: Creates new form of the same word.
- Grammatical - number, tense, case, gender.
  Example:  $bring$ - verb,  $brought$ - verb,  $brings$ - verb,  $bringing$ - verb.

-  **Derivational Morphology**: Creates new words by changing part of speech.
- Some pattern can be observed when creating new word but that pattern may have exceptions like $sincere$ - $sincerity$ ,  $scarce$ - $scarcity$  but $fierce$ - $fiercity$  is not correct.
  Example:  $logic$ - noun,  $logical$ - adjective , $illogical$ - adjective, $illogicality$ - noun.


### Morphological processes
##### Concatenation
- Adding continuous affixes - the most common process:
  Example:  $hope$ + $less$ = $hopeless$
-  Often, there are phonological / graphemic changes on morpheme boundaries:
  Example:  $book$ + $s$ $[s]$  , $shoe$ + $s$ $[z]$   (pronounced differently - phonological change)
  $happy$ + $er$  = $happier$  (written differently - graphemic change).

##### Reduplication
 - Part of the word or the entire word is doubled.

-  Here the Hindi translation will be $kamre$ $ka$ $tapman$  and not $kamra$ $tapman$.
