-  Minimum number of editing operations 
	a. Insertion
	b. Deletion
	c. Substitution
Example: intention --> execution = 5 operations.

**Note:** If the weight of each operation in 1, then the summation of all the weights is called 
**Levenstein Distance**.

Considering n and m are sizes of string.

**Time Complexity** - $O(n * m)$
**Space Complexity - $O(n * m)$
Backtrace  - $O(n + m)$
