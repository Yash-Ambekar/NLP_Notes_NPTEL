Why add weights?
-> Some letters are more likely to be mistyped. If the error is more likely then the edit cost from one char to another char should be low and vice versa.

Algorithm with defined edit cost for each character vs character operation:

#### Case of Metathesis

So we also add the cost of Metathesis when taking the min of all operation distances.

## **IMPORTANT:** 
Generating the edit distance <= 2 (deletion + transpose + substitution + insertion) of all possible terms in dictionary with the query term to get a match at runtime can be a tedious task. 

To make it easier we can make use of **Symmetric Delete Spelling Correction**.

##### Example:
**Query:** WOTLD 
**Correct Word:** WORLD
Here you will find edit distance between the word in the dictionary and the query only when at least one term generated after deletion ($<=2$) operation of the query word matches with the term generated by the dictionary word after deletion ($<=2$) operation.

And the word with the least edit distance or below a threshold between the query term is the correct answer.

This process is more efficient as one part of it is done offline and even this process does not take much time as we are only carrying out a single operation (deletion).
