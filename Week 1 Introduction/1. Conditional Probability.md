#### Derivation of the Conditional Probability Formula:

$P(A|B)$  represents the probability of event $A$  occurring given that event $B$  has already occurred. In other words, it measures the likelihood of event A happening among the subset of outcomes where event B has already taken place.
###### Prove:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B|A)}{P(B)}$$
###### Proof:

-  The conditional probability of event $A$  given event $B$  is defined as:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$
-  Dividing $P(A \cap B)$  by $P(B)$  essentially normalizes the joint probability by the probability of event $B$.  It gives us the proportion of event $B$  outcomes where event $A$  also occurs, out of all the outcomes where event $B$  occurs.

-  Definition of Joint Probability:

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A)$$

-  This equation states that the probability of both events $A$ and  $B$ occurring is equal to the probability of event A happening multiplied by the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred.

-  Dividing both sides of the equation by $P(B)$, we get:

$$ \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B|A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

-  Recognizing that $P(A|B)$  is the probability of event $A$ given event $B$, the derivation concludes:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B|A)}{P(B)}$$



#### Derivation of the Chain Rule of Probability

- The chain rule of probability allows us to calculate the joint probability of multiple events by considering their conditional probabilities.

-  Consider a set of events $A1, A2, A3, ..., An$. We want to calculate the joint probability of all these events occurring together.
  
###### Prove:
-  Using the definition of conditional probability, we can express the joint probability as:

$$P(A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_n) = P(A_1) \cdot P(A_2|A_1) \cdot P(A_3|A_1, A_2) \cdot ... \cdot P(A_n|A_1, A_2, ..., A_{n-1})$$
$$P(A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_n)= \prod\limits_{i = 1}^{n} P(A_i|A_1,...,A_{i-1})$$
###### Proof:
-  Each term in this product represents the probability of an event given that all the previous events have occurred. By applying the definition of conditional probability repeatedly, we can derive the chain rule.

-  For example, to derive the term $P(A_3|A_1, A_2)$, we can write:

$$P(A_3|A_1, A_2) = \frac{P(A_3 \cap (A_1, A_2))}{P(A_1, A_2)}$$

-  Expanding the joint probabilities, we have:

$$P(A_3|A_1, A_2) = \frac{P(A_3 \cap A_1 \cap A_2)}{P(A_1 \cap A_2)}$$

-  We also have $P(A2|A1)$  similarly,

$$P(A_2|A_1) = \frac{P(A_2\cap A_1)}{P(A_1)}$$

-  Substitute these probabilities to the $RHS$  of the equation

$$  
RHS= P(A_1) \cdot P(A_2|A_1) \cdot P(A_3|A_1, A_2) \cdot ... \cdot P(A_n|A_1, A_2, ..., A_{n-1}) 
$$
$$
= P(A_1)\cdot \frac{P(A_2\cap A_1)}{P(A_1)} \cdot \frac{P(A_3 \cap A_1 \cap A_2)}{P(A_1 \cap A_2)}\cdot ...\cdot \frac{P(A_n \cap A_1 \cap A_2....\cap A_{n-1})}{P(A_1 \cap A_2....\cap A_{n-1})}
$$

-  Cancel out the common terms and you get 
$$P(A_n \cap A_1 \cap A_2....\cap A_{n-1})= P(A_1 \cap A_2....\cap A_{n-1} \cap A_n) = LHS$$
-  This derivation demonstrates how the chain rule allows us to decompose the joint probability into a product of conditional probabilities.
